Drills
Let's confirm some of this new knowledge with a few basic exercises. Write SQL queries to return:

The IDs and durations for all trips of duration greater than 500, ordered by duration:

select trip_id, duration from trips
	where duration > 500
	order by duration asc;

Every column of the stations table for station id 84:

select * from stations
	where station_id = 84;
  
The min temperatures of all the occurrences of rain in zip 94301:

select mintemperaturef from weather
	where zip = 94301
	and (events = 'Rain' or precipitationin > 0);
  
Save your SQL queries in a gist or a GitHub repository and submit a link below.
